    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Calton Heights</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Modeled after San Francisco's Pacific Heights, Calton Heights, like Pacific Heights, is situated on one of the highest points in the city.

        Calton Heights is an affluent district. A safehouse is located here which can be purchased by Carl Johnson. At $100,000, it is the most expensive safehouse in San Fierro. This house sits at the top of one of San Fierro's most prominent landmarks, Windy Windy Windy Windy Street (which is modeled after San Francisco's Lombard Street, known as the "crookedest street").
        
        Calton Heights has a long tunnel running underneath it. It connects Financial to the east, and Juniper Hollow to the west. Cesar Vialpando introduces nitrous to Carl Johnson in this tunnel during the mission "Test Drive."
        
        Calton Heights is also a territory of the San Fierro Triads, a local gang. A great number of Triads are seen patrolling this area, whether it be on foot or on their respective gang vehicles. Their surprisingly gentle mannerisms and peculiar politeness belie the fact that they guard their territory fiercely, and will not hesitate to shoot (often with AK-47s) at anyone engaging in carjacking or other criminal behavior on the streets of Calton Heights.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Chinatown</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Chinatown lies north of King's, east of Santa Flora and Juniper Hill, and south of Calton Heights. San Fierro's Chinatown is modeled after that of San Francisco's one, and even contains a replica of the decorated archway at the intersection of Bush Street and Grant Avenue that acts as an entrance to the neighborhood.

        Chinatown is Mountain Cloud Boys Triad turf, and is defended fiercely by its overtly polite members, who often shoot AK-47s at anyone engaging in criminal activity on the streets. Chinatown is also the San Fierro base for Wu Zi Mu (Woozie), the leader of the Mountain Cloud Boys.</p>
